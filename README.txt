This is an exercise in using a Naive Bayes classifier on a large, high dimensional
dataset. As pixels are highly corrilated with one another, this is certianly not an optimal model for image recognition. As such, a test accuracy of only about 82% is obtained.

The folder "mean_images" contains images with the mean value of each pixel for that digit.
